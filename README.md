# Blackjack TUI

## Description

This is an implementation of the game blackjack in a Terminal UI format. The application has two parts, the server and the client. Eventually it will be finished so you can launch either with a CLI command and play blackjack over the internet with your friends. To start this project I used Claude to create a project spec which I could follow and implement to work on my programming chops. I have used Claude as well to try and think through problems, but all of the code in the project is grass-fed and hand-written by yours truly.

## Purpose

My goal in creating this project is to learn more about how to design software well. I'm learning that the key to good software is minimizing complexity. We do not want to be complexitymaxers here. I intend to get this reviewed by some people in a discord chat when I'm done and see what kind of improvements I could make on it. Really the goal is to become the best software engineer I can and learn to do things excellently. Also I think building projects like this will help hone my instinct on how software should be built and designed.
